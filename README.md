# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System

This project consists of two parts:

Face Detection and Data Capture: \
Uses OpenCV to capture and store 100 facial images of a user from a webcam. \
Facial data is saved in pickle files for future use in attendance tracking. \
The Haarcascade Classifier is used for real-time face detection. \

Real-Time Attendance Display: \
A Streamlit app that reads attendance data from a CSV file and displays it in real-time. \
The app auto-refreshes every 2 seconds and features a FizzBuzz counter to demonstrate the auto-refresh functionality. \

Key Technologies: \ 
Face Detection: OpenCV, Haarcascade Classifier \
Real-Time Display: Streamlit, Pandas
